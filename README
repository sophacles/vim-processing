Vim processing.

This is an extension of Vim script #2115. It started simply as an easy git repo
to bundle and use with pathogen, but has grown as I use Processing more.

I have made two sets of modifications so far:

1) Documentation is now browsable locally or on the web. If you set the
variable processing_doc_style to "local" it will use a local copy of the
Processing docs (and requires you to set the variable processing_doc_path to
point to the root of the documents). If you set processing_doc_style to "web"
it will point your browser at the Processing site when you use attempt to use
the documentation hookup.  (normal mode K)

2) Sketches can now be run directly from Vim using the :RunProcessing command,
which is bound to the F5 key by default.

Sketches are run using one of two methods. On Windows and Linux, and on OS
X with the g:use_processing_java variable set, the processing-java command is
used. This tool is used to run sketches outside of the Processing editor, and is
supplied with Processing itself. Make sure processing-java is in your PATH
before trying to run it from vim-processing.

On OS X without g:use_processing_java set, an AppleScript script is used to tell
Processing to run the sketch in question. For this to properly work, the
Processing editor must already be running with the pde file open, and it works
best if the "use external editor" preference is selected. That feature has been
removed in recent versions of Processing, with the developers recommending the
use of processing-java instead. The AppleScript is retained as the default on OS
X so as not to break anything for existing users.
