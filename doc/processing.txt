INTRODUCTION                                         *processing-introduction*

processing-vim is a plugin for integrating the Processing graphics programming
language and environment with vim. Since Processing 2.0 this has become
increasingly easy, and it is possible to use vim as a complete replacement to
the IDE provided with processing.

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, integration of the compiler and
vim's |:make|, and easy access to the help documentation. Basic usage is
accomplished by installing this plugin by unzipping it in your vim runtime
path (or in association with your favorite vim plugin manager). Then navigate
to the appropriate Processing directory and edit your sketches. When you're
ready to run them, simply pressing <F5> or doing :make will compile and run
the sketch - and provide a |quickfix| window of the errors processing
encounters.

OSX users please note that to use this plugin to it's fullest, you need to
install the processing-java command line manually, and this step must be done
each time processing is installed or upgraded. To do this simply use the menus
and navigate to: >
   Tools -> Install processing-java
<and the installation will happen.

Processing-vim also provides access to the processing documentation by moving
the cursor over the target word and pressing K in normal mode. This will open
a browser pointed to the right place.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                      *processing-cmd*

:RunProcessing                                                *:RunProcessing*
<F5>
        Runs the compiler for processing, taking into account the settings
        defined by the |processing-variables|, This works even with the
        settings for backwards compatibility using the applescript hack on OSX
        in conjunction with older processing versions ( < 2.0)

K                                                             *processing-doc*
        Opens a browser to the processing documentation for the item under the
        cursor. The location of the documentation can be local or the web
        version, depending on the value of |g:processing_doc_style|. If the
        openbrowser plugin is available, it will use that, otherwise
        processing-vim will attempt to open a browser on it's own.

==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                               *processing-variables*

g:processing_doc_style                                *g:processing_doc_style*
         Can be set to 'local' or 'web' . 'web' will point the browser at the
         online documentation for processing when the K command is used.
         'local' will point the browser to the documentation directory in
         |g:processing_doc_path|

g:processing_doc_path                                  *g:processing_doc_path*
         The base path for a local installation of the processing
         documentation.

g:use_processing_applescript                    *g:use_processing_applescript*
        If this is set to true, processing-vim will use the older version of
        compilation and script-running based on an apple script. This is
        recommended only for backwards compatibility, not for versions of
        processing newer than 2.0.  For more info see |processing-applescript|

==============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES                                               *processing-issues*

* Due to processing-java's output, the error reporting leaves something to be
  desired this will improve as processing-java improves

* Right now :make compiles and launches the sketch. New variable and commands
  to control this behavior are in the works

==============================================================================
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY                             *processing-compatibility*
                                                      *processing-applescript*

Older versions of this plugin were intended to be used with processing 1.X,
which didn't export the processing-java command line tool. For Mac OSX users
this script included an AppleScript which could be used to provide limited
control over the processing runtime from within vim. If you have backwards
compatible needs, and wish to use this functionality on an OSX machine - you
can set |g:use_processing_applescript| to true. Then you must run the
Processing app, and set the "use external editor" setting. Once this is done,
you can use the processing runtime to compile and launch sketches with the
<F5> key.

Note: This function is no longer supported and will be phased out in
future versions.
