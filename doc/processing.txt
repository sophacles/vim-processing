INTRODUCTION                                                *processing-intro*

processing-vim is a plugin for integrating the Processing graphics programming
language and environment with vim. Since Processing 2.0 this has become
increasingly easy, and it is possible to use vim as a complete replacement to
the IDE provided with processing.

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, integration of the compiler and
vim's |:make|, and easy access to the help documentation. Basic usage is
accomplished by installing this plugin by unzipping it in your vim runtime
path (or in association with your favorite vim plugin manager). Then navigate
to the appropriate Processing directory and edit your sketches. When you're
ready to run them, simply pressing <F5> or doing :make will compile and run
the sketch - and provide a |quickfix| window of the errors processing
encounters.

OSX users please note that to use this plugin to it's fullest, you need to
install the processing-java command line manually, and this step must be done
each time processing is installed or upgraded. To do this simply use the menus
and navigate to: >
   Tools -> Install processing-java
<and the installation will happen.

Processing-vim also provides access to the processing documentation by moving
the cursor over the target word and pressing K in normal mode. This will open
a browser pointed to the right place.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE                                               *processing-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                      *processing-cmd*

:RunProcessing                                                *:RunProcessing*
        Runs the compiler for processing, taking into account the settings
        defined by the |processing-variables|. This works even with the
        settings for backwards compatibility using the applescript hack on OSX
        in conjunction with older processing versions ( < 2.0)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS                                        *processing-key-mappings*

<Plug>(processing-keyword)                       *<Plug>(processing-keyword)*
        Opens a browser to the processing documentation for the item under the
        cursor. The location of the documentation can be local or the web
        version, depending on the value of |g:processing_doc_style|. If the
        openbrowser plugin is available, it will use that, otherwise
        processing-vim will attempt to open a browser on it's own.

<Plug>(processing-run)                               *<Plug>(processing-run)*
        Runs the compiler for processing. For more info, see |:RunProcessing|.

                                            *processing_default_key_mappings*
The following key mappings are available unless
|g:processing_no_default_mappings| is defined:

{lhs}           {rhs}
--------        -----------------------------
K               <Plug>(processing-keyword)
<F5>            <Plug>(processing-run)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES                                               *processing-variables*

g:processing_doc_style                                *g:processing_doc_style*
        Can be set to 'local' or 'web' . 'web' will point the browser at the
        online documentation for processing when the K command is used.
        'local' will point the browser to the documentation directory in
        |g:processing_doc_path|.

g:processing_doc_path                                  *g:processing_doc_path*
        The base path for a local installation of the processing documentation.

g:processing_fold                                          *g:processing_fold*
        If this is defined, set the 'foldmethod' option to "syntax".

g:use_processing_applescript                    *g:use_processing_applescript*
        If this is defined, processing-vim will use the older version of
        compilation and script-running based on an apple script. This is
        recommended only for backwards compatibility, not for versions of
        processing newer than 2.0.  For more info see |processing-applescript|.

g:processing_no_default_mappings            *g:processing_no_default_mappings*
        If this is defined, don't map the defalt key mappings.

==============================================================================
SYNTAX UPDATE                                              *processing-syntax*

In the case the syntax, keywords and/or functions of the processing language
change before the script maintainers update it, or if you are using a
development version of Processing with a newer keywords.txt file, the tools/
directory has some tools to make this task simple.

These tools use python2, (>=python 2.7).

The steps are simple:

1. Get the latest keywords.txt from Processing. This is located in the
processing installation dir, under Java/modes/keywords.txt

2. cd to the tools/ directory and run the make_syntax script. It takes one
argument, the path to the keywords.txt file, and prints the output to stdout.
On unix systems this can simply be redirected to a file. >
   $> python make_syntax.py /path/to/processing/keywords.txt > \
   ../syntax/processing.vim.new

<Which will output the new syntax in the syntax directory.

3. Ensure the changes are OK for you - using the compare.py script in the
tools/ directory, you can see the changes between the two files. >
    $> python compare.py ../syntax/processing.vim ../syntax/processing.vim.new
<If you're happy with the results you can replace the original syntax file
with the new file >
    $> mv ../syntax/processing.vim.new ../syntax/processing.vim
<If not, edit the syntax until it is good. (Please consider creating an issue
for ways the utility did not satisfy your needs, with how you had to edit it.)

See the code in the tools/ directory for more detail on how these work and
additional options for using the utilities.

==============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES                                               *processing-issues*

* Due to processing-java's output, the error reporting leaves something to be
  desired this will improve as processing-java improves

* Right now :make compiles and launches the sketch. New variable and commands
  to control this behavior are in the works

==============================================================================
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY                             *processing-compatibility*
                                                      *processing-applescript*

Older versions of this plugin were intended to be used with processing 1.X,
which didn't export the processing-java command line tool. For Mac OSX users
this script included an AppleScript which could be used to provide limited
control over the processing runtime from within vim. If you have backwards
compatible needs, and wish to use this functionality on an OSX machine - you
can define |g:use_processing_applescript|. Then you must run the
Processing app, and set the "use external editor" setting. Once this is done,
you can use the processing runtime to compile and launch sketches with the
<F5> key.

Note: This function is no longer supported and will be phased out in
future versions.
